# TRUTH-SPECTROGRAM
AI-Generated Voice Detection (Tamil, English, Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu)

Introduction

AI systems can now generate very realistic human-like voices. Because of this, it is difficult to identify whether a voice recording was spoken by a real human or generated by an AI system.

In this problem, students must build an API-based solution that detects whether a given voice sample is AI-generated or Human, across five supported languages.

Supported Languages (Fixed)

Your system must support only these five languages:

Tamil

English

Hindi

Malayalam

Telugu

Each request will contain one audio file in one of the above languages.

What You Need to Build

You must design and deploy a REST API that:

Accepts one MP3 audio file at a time

Audio will be sent only as Base64

Analyzes the voice

Returns whether the voice is:

AI_GENERATED

HUMAN

Responds in JSON format
